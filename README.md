Scenario
You are a data analyst intern at PageTurner Books, a small independent bookstore.
The store sells items like Novels, Comics, Magazines, and Stationery.

Each day, the shop staff records:

Date of sale

Product name

Quantity sold

Price per unit

The store has been keeping this information in a spreadsheet, but the store owner now wants a quick way to generate monthly and product-wise reports without manually calculating everything.

The Problem
The owner wants to know:

Total items sold and total revenue during any period.

Which product type sells the most.

Which month earns the highest revenue.

Product performance trends over time.

Your Solution
You build a Tiny SQLite database called sales_data and write Python + SQL scripts to:

Store the daily sales records

Calculate total sales and total revenue

Show product-wise totals and revenue

Show monthly sales patterns
